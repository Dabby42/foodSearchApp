# foodSearchApp
A react-native mobile application that consumes the yelp restaurant api to render various classes of restaurant in finely spaced horizontal flat list.

The categories to which this application classifies these available restaurant are Fast food, Fast Casual and Fine dinning. 

Each of the categories are allocated a finely spaced horizintal block for the listing of available restaurant. 

If for any reason, the response to which the yelp api provides doesn't have in it one that falls into these 3 categories, the block will seize to display with the heading set to null.

Also the app also provides for the case for users to dive in to having an overview of what each restaurant service looks like and the type of meals available by clicking on the restaurant represented
by its image.
